## Introduction to Software modeling and analysis
<sup>This repository is part of the **Software modeling and analysis course** for regular students of Software Engineering at Plovdiv University..</sup>\
This repository is part of the Software Modeling and Analysis course for Computer Science students at Plovdiv University. The course is designed to provide an overview of the principles of building a database model according to the program specifications for software projects. Defining a conceptual, logical, and physical model of the data allows verification of program specifications and a better understanding of data flow and management methods from all parties in the project.

Course participants are introduced to the theory and formal processes of data modeling for various purposes.

### POLL

### Competencies
Upon successful completion of this course, participants will:
#### Knowledge:
* Understand the main types of specialized documents used in creating database models.
* Understand how conceptual, logical, and physical data models relate to functional requirements.
#### Skills:
* Identify the constituent elements of the model and their attributes.
* Define the relationships between the elements of the model.
* Define business rules for data integrity and content.
* Achieve data integrity through normalization.
* Design models for various practical purposes.

### Course Structure
The course is structured into several key sections, each focusing on a different aspect of data modeling. The sections are designed to be followed in order.
